# Wutsapp
Wutsapp is a collection of funny instant message conversations taken from the web, created and handcrafted by [Valerio Pierbattista](http://valeriopierbattista.com) and [Patrizio Munzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriziomunzi).

Check it out at www.wutsapp.net.

# Contribute
Please contribute with your funny conversations (either originals or transcribed from ones you find on the web) with a *Pull Request* or via [email](mailto:omegaiori@gmail.com).

# Installation
To run Wutsapp locally, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system, but also Bower, Grunt, Sass and Compass. If you are on Windows, you'll need to install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) as well. After you have installed Node, clone the repository and install **Bower** with
```
npm install -g bower
```
install **Grunt Cli** with 
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
then on the root of Wutsapp folder, type

- `bower install` (Bower's dependencies)
- `npm install` (Grunt's dependencies)
- `npm install grunt-postcss autoprefixer-core` (postcss and autoprefixer support)
- `gem install sass` (sass support)
- `gem install compass` (compass support)

When you're all set, type `grunt` (or `grunt dist`) - this will open a browser window with Wutsapp running. Most of the changes (scss, js, html etc.) will autorefresh the browser window.
